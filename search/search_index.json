Architecture Overview Here's a diagram of what we are going to build. This environment consists of a VPC in the us-east-1 region with two subnets. The subnets containts an Amazon EC2 bastion host running Amazon Linux 2 used for running AWS CLI commands and a private, not publicly-accessible, Amazon RDS MySQL database instance. The subnets are chosen based on the presence of a VPC endpoint for AWS Secrets Manager. When we initiate a rotation of the RDS database, the AWS Lambda function that Secrets Manager uses will reach out to the Amazon RDS database to perform the rotation. Security Note Security Note For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses jq to parse the secret value into environment variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables. Prerequisites In order to complete this workshop you'll need the following: * an AWS Account with administrator access to services used in the module including AWS Secrets Manager, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon VPC Charges You will incur charges for the services used in these modules. The pricing for each service is available on that service's pricing page. 1. Choose a region You need to choose a region that offers AWS Secrets Manager and Amazon RDS. For information about service availability, check the region table . Tip: The AWS region name is always listed in the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, in the navigation bar. Make a note of the AWS region name , for example, US East (N. Virginia) . For more information about regions, see: AWS Regions and Endpoints . 2. Complete initial environment configuration (expand for details) In this section, you will use AWS CloudFormation to build the environment shown in the diagram above. Complete all the steps below unless they are marked \"optional.\" 2.1. Download the AWS Cloudformation template and save it to your workstation. 2.2. In the AWS Management Console, Under Management Tools, Select CloudFormation . 2.3. Click the Create stack button. 2.4. Select the Upload a template to Amazon S3 radio button. 2.5. Click the Choose file button and use the file navigation pop-up to select the CloudFormation template you just downloaded. 2.6. Click the Next button. Enter the values below into Stack name and parameter fields: Field name Value Stack name You can choose or just use smdemo Enter the name of the database Accept the default value of smdemo Enter the TCP port for the database endpoint Accept the default value of 3306 Enter a prefix for the Name tag Accept the default value of smdemo Enter the value for the Project tag Accept the default value of smproj Enter the SSM AMI Id Parameter Accept the default value - Do not change! 2.7. Click the Next button. 2.8. On the Options page, click the Next button. 2.9. On the Review page, check the acknowledgement box and click the Create button. AWS CloudFormation will the build the resource stack. This may take 15-20 minutes to complete. Wait until the status of the stack changes to \"CREATE_COMPLETE.\" You can periodically refresh the page to update the status. If the stack creation fails, look at the bottom of the page and select the Events tab. You should be able to see the reason for the failure in the Status Reason column. A common reason for a failure is not having specified some of the parameters when creating the stack. 2.10. Let's take a look at the Output section of the CloudFormation stack. The outputs values include the RDS master username and password, both of which are set to random alphanumeric strings for added security. You will store the DBUser and DBPassword values as a secret in Secrets Manager. You will se the DBEndpoint value to help you select the correct database in Secrets Manager. Another output value is the IP address of the bastion host. You will need this IP address to set up a connection to the bastion host later in this module. Keep this window open. 3. Store the secret value in AWS Secrets Manager (expand for details) In this section, you will store the RDS database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. You will use the DBUser and DBPassword values that were output from the AWS CloudFormation. - __3.1.__ Open the [AWS Secrets Manager Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home) in a new tab or window. - __3.2.__ Click **Store a new secret**. - __3.3.__ Select the **Credentials for RDS database** radio button. - __3.4.__ Copy the values for the DBUser and DBPassword CloudFormation output values that you got from item 2.10 above into the **User name** and **Password** fields respectively. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see a list of your RDS instances. Using the DBendpoint output value that you got from item 2.10 above, select the RDS instance. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 1](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore1.png) - __3.5.__ Click **Next**. - __3.6.__ Enter a name for the secret. You can pick a name or just use **smdemo** as shown below. Note that this must bot be the name of a secret that is pending deletion. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 2](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore2.png) - __3.7.__ Click **Next**. - __3.8__ Select **Disable automatic rotation** and then click **Next**. We will enable rotation later in this module. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 3](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore3.png) - __3.9.__ Click **Store**. You have now stored your secret value as shown below. ![AWS Secrets Manager store secret part 4](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSSMStore4.png) 4. Connect to the Amazon EC2 bastion host and access the RDS database (expand for details) In this section, you will connect to the bastion host so you can run scripts that the CloudFormation template has created on the instance. ___Complete all the steps below unless they are marked \"optional.\"___ - __4.1.__ Connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. - __4.2.__ After you login, use the **sudo su ec2-user** command since the ec2-user id is the owner of all the scripts. - __4.3.__ Change to the home directory of the ec2-user id by entering the **cd** command without any arguments. - __4.4.__ Use the **ls** command to list the contents of the home directory. You will see two shell scripts. * mysql.oldway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"old\" way, using a hard-coded password. * mysql.newway.sh - This shell script connects to the database the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. - __4.5.__ Let's take a look at the file mysql.oldway.sh. You can use the **cat** command to do this. In the example below, the values PASSWORD, USER, and ENDPOINT represent the hard-coded database password, username, and host endpoint. \u0002wzxhzdk:0\u0003 - __4.6.__ Now let's try this script by running the following commands. The first command invokes the script. The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. \u0002wzxhzdk:1\u0003 You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"old\" way, with a hard-coded user name and password. You may be wondering why MariaDB appears in the image below. Amazon Linux 2 includes the MariaDB port of the **mysql** command as an \"extras\" module. The **mysql** program is compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB. ![AWS Secrets Manager old way before rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLoldpre.png) - __4.7.__ Let's take a look at the file mysql.newway.sh. You can use the **cat** command to do this. As mentioned above, for the sake of simplicity, the scripts used in the tutorial use *jq* to parse the secret value into shell variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables, and work with them in plaintext at the command line. \u0002wzxhzdk:2\u0003 - __4.8.__ Now let's try this script by running the following commands. The first command invokes the script. **Note that you must specify the name of the secret!** The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. \u0002wzxhzdk:3\u0003 You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. ![AWS Secrets Manager new way before rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLnewpre.png) 5. Enable AWS Secrets Manager and perform the first password rotation (expand for details) In this section, you will enable the rotation of the secret you created in AWS Secrets Manager. - __5.1.__ Go to the main screen of the AWS Secrets Manager console. - __5.2.__ Click on the secret that you previously created. - __5.3.__ Click **Edit rotation**. - __5.4.__ Select **Enable automatic rotation**. Choose **30 days** for the rotation interval. Click **Use this secret** because we will be using the credentials of this secret to access the database and then rotate the same credentials. Click **Save** to begin the process. ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 1](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate1.png) - __5.5.__ You will see a message telling you that the rotation is beginning and that you should remain on the page until it is complete. AWS Secrets Manager is now using the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) to install an [AWS Lambda rotation](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function on your behalf. **Do not leave this page until the rotation is complete.** ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 2](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate2.png) A message will appear when the rotation is complete. **Refresh your browser window to update your any cached fields.** ![AWS Secrets Manager rotation part 3](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSRotate3.png) - __5.6.__ Click **Retrieve secret value** to see the new password value. 6. Connect to the database after rotating the password (expand for details) Let's try to connect to the database again, both the \"old\" way with a hard-coded password, the \"new\" way with AWS Secrets Manager. - __6.1.__ On the bastion host, repeat step 4.6 with the **mysql.oldway.sh** script. You should receive an error message (access denied) because the mysql.oldway.sh script has the same hard-coded password. ![AWS Secrets Manager old way after rotation](img/1_RotatePrivateRDSMSQLoldpost.png) - __6.2.__ Repeat step 4.8 with the **mysql.newway.sh** script. You should be able to connect to the database just as you did before since this script uses AWS Secrets Manager to fetch the updated credentials. 7. Clean up (expand for details) Now that you have seen how AWS Secrets Manager can rotate the credentials for a private database, please follow these steps to remove the resources you created, including the private database. - __7.1.__ [Delete the secret you created in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-restore-secret.html?shortFooter=true). Note that when you delete a secret, the deletion is scheduled for a minimum of seven days in the future. - __7.2.__ When you enabled rotation on your secret, AWS Secrets Manager used AWS CloudFormation to create an AWS Lambda function to do the rotation using the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). Go to the AWS CloudFormation console and delete this stack. The name of the stack begins with the following string: **aws-serverless-repository-SecretsManagerRDSMySQLRotationSingleUser** Look for a stack with this naming convention that was created at about the same time as you enabled rotation. **Do not proceed to the next step until this stack has been deleted.** - __7.3.__ [Delete the main CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) that you created in steps 2.1 through 2.9. The stack deletion process may take several minutes to complete. If the stack deletion process either pauses or fails, it may be because of an Elastic Network Interface that gets created when rotation is enabled. If you delete this interface and restart the stack deletion. 8. Conclusion You have completed this module.

You should be familiar with Docker concepts. Overview In this phase, you will learn how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate. AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon Elastic Container Service that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them. The CloudFormation template for this workshop round created a Dockerfile and some helper shell scripts. You will use these shell scripts to build the Docker image and push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), a fully-managed Docker container registry. This guide does not go into the details of these scripts. You are encouraged to read them to learn what they do to gain a better understanding of Docker, Amazon ECR, and AWS Fargate. Lastly as a reminder, the environment provisioned by CloudFormation is shown in the figure below. Build and push the Docker image If you are do not have a session open to the bastion host, then connect to the bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. To do this: Go to the Systems Manager console. Select Session Manager . Click Start session . Select the radio button for the instance associated with the bastion host. Click Start session . The scripts you will be using are owned by the ec2-user account. If you are not currently using ec2-user as your effective user id, then enter the command below to change your effective user id and directory to those of ec2-user: sudo su - ec2-user Run this script to build the Docker image: ./dockerbuild.sh This command creates the Docker image based on the Dockerfile that was generated by CloudFormation. The build process can take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompts you for another command before continuing. Confirm that the image was built by using this command: docker images You should see a repository whose name contans -ecrre- that was recently built. Run the following script to push the image to Amazon ECR to make the image available to AWS Fargate: dockertagandpush.sh This script will take a few minutes to complete. Wait until the shell prompt appears before continuing. You have now built the Docker image and pushed it to Amazon ECR. You will now configure AWS Fargate. Configure and launch AWS Fargate You will now configure the Amazon Elastic Container Service Task Definition that AWS Fargate will use to launch the task. After you confgure the task definition, you will launch the AWS Fargate task. Go to the ECS Console window and select the Clusters menu item. You should see a cluster whose name begins with the stack name you chose and contains the string -ECSCluster- . The cluster description should look similar to that shown in the figure below. Click the Task Definitions menu item. You should see a task definition whose name contains -TaskDefinition- as shown below. Click the check box next to the appropriate task definition name and then click Create new revision . Leave all of the current values in place. Scroll down and click Configure via JSON . Look for the list named secrets . It should look similar to what is shown in the figure below. Replace SECRETNAME with the name of the secret you stoed in the RDS phase. Click Save to save the revised JSON definition. Click Create to create the new revision of the Task Definition that includes the JSON revisions. You will see a message saying that the new revision has been created. Notice that the revision has a version number attached to it as shown in the figure below. Click the Actions button and select Run Task from the dropdown menu. Choose the values listed in the table below. Field Value Launch type Fargate Cluster VPC The VPC that was created by CloudFormation with the 10.200.0.0/16 subnet Subnets Select all of the subnets listed Security group Select the group whose name includes BastionSG Leave all other values at their current settings. Click Run Task . Refresh the Task window at the bottom to update the status. The status will start at PROVISIONING , then change to PENDING , and then to RUNNING*. Now that you have launched the Fargate task, you are ready to connect to the container. Connect to the Fargate contaner Click on the task name to display details of the task and note the private IP associated with the task. The private IP should begin with 10.200 . The third octet should be either 11 or 12. This private IP of the Fargate task has been connected to your VPC. From the Systems Manager Session Manager session you started above, while sudo'd as ec2-user, enter the following command: ssh PrvateIpOfFargateTask Replace PrivateIPOfFargateTask with the private IP of the Fargate task. You will be prompted for the password. Enter the value from the EC2UserPassword output value from the CloudFormation stack. You should now see a shell prompt. Access the database Now that you have connected to the AWS Fargate container, you can now access the RDS database. After you access the database you will learn how the scripts receive the secret value from the ECS Task Definition. Run the command below to access the RDS database. Note that you do not supply the name of a secret since that has been passed in the task definition. ./mysql.newway.sh The output should be similar to what you see in the figure below. Examine the flow of the secret Now that you have been able to access the database through Fargate, it's important to understand how the value made its way from the Task Definition to the mysql.newway.sh script. It's important to understand that there may be multiple ways to accomplish this depending on what is running in the container. Since this container is running a Linux shell, the path the secret value flowed took advantage of the capabilities of the shell. In the task definition JSON that you modified above, you modified the value of the valueFrom key to be the ARN of the secret that you stored in Secrets Manager. The corresponding name key has as its value the name of an environment variable that will be presented to the Fargate task container when it is instantiated. The Dockerfile that is used to build the Docker image for Fargate has the following as its last line: CMD /home/ec2-user/startprocesses.sh This means that when Fargate launches the Docker image, the image will run the startproceses.sh file. Here are the contents of the main portion of that file: touch /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh env | \\ grep \"^TASKDEF_\" | \\ awk -F= '{printf \"export %s=%c%s%c\\n\", $1, 39, $2, 39 }' \\ &gt;&gt; /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh You can see that the startprocesses.sh script creates another script named /etc/profile.d/ecs.sh. Each line in ecs.sh contains the definitions of every environment variable passed to the container whose environment variable names start with TASKDEF_ . Since the file exists in the /etc/profile.d directory, each time a user logs in, the ecs.sh file willl be \"sourced\" by the shell causing the environment variables to be set for the logged in user. To confirm that the secret value has been passed, enter the following command from the Fargate container shell prompt: env|grep TASKDEF_SECRET You should see a value similar to that in the figure below. This shows that the Task Definition properly retrieved the secret information and passed it to the Fargate container which in turn made it available to the login shell. Conclusion You have completed ths Fargate phase and have learned how to use AWS Secrets Manager with AWS Fargate. Please proceed to the Clean up phase to remove the environment created by AWS CloudFormation.","title":"Fargate phase"},{"location":"RDSFargateRound/Fargate/#rds-and-fargate-round-fargate-phase","text":"","title":"RDS and Fargate Round - Fargate Phase"},{"location":"RDSFargateRound/Fargate/#prerequisites","text":"You must complete the RDS phase of this workshop round before starting this phase.

Security Note For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses jq to parse the secret value into environment variables to allow for easy command line manipulation. This is NOT a security best practice for a production environment. In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables. View the CloudFormation stack Go to the CloudFormation console and identify the stack that you built. The list of stacks will look similar to the figure below.

The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. ./mysql.newway.sh smdemo use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below. This shows that you can access the database, the \"new\" way, using AWS Secrets Manager. Rotate the secret In this section, you will enable the rotation of the secret you created in AWS Secrets Manager. Go to the main screen of the AWS Secrets Manager console. Click on the secret that you previously created. Click Edit rotation . Select Enable automatic rotation . Choose 30 days for the rotation interval. Click Use this secret because we will be using the credentials of this secret to access the database and then rotate the same credentials. Click Save to begin the process. You will see a message telling you that the rotation is beginning and that you should remain on the page until it is complete. AWS Secrets Manager is now using the AWS Serverless Application Repository to install an AWS Lambda rotation function on your behalf. Do not leave this page until the rotation is complete. A message will appear when the rotation is complete. Refresh your browser window to update your any cached fields. Click Retrieve secret value to see the new password value. Access the database after the rotation Let's try to connect to the database again, both the \"old\" way with a hard-coded password, the \"new\" way with AWS Secrets Manager. On the bastion host, use the mysql.oldway.sh script again as you did before the rotation. You should receive an error message (access denied) because the mysql.oldway.sh script has the same hard-coded password. Use the mysql.newway.sh script followed by the name of the secret as you did before the rotation. You should be able to connect to the database just as you did before since this script uses AWS Secrets Manager to fetch the updated credentials.

In a production environment, we recommend that you don't store passwords in environment variables, and work with them in plaintext at the command line. #/bin/bash # This is the new way of accessing a database, with AWS Secrets Manager. if [ $# -ne 1 ] then echo usage: $0 SecretName exit 1 fi secret=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id $1 --region us-east-1 | jq .SecretString | jq fromjson) user=$(echo $secret | jq -r .username) password=$(echo $secret | jq -r .password) endpoint=$(echo $secret | jq -r .host) port=$(echo $secret | jq -r .port) mysql \\ -p$password \\ -u $user \\ -P $port \\ -h $endpoint Run the mysql.newway.sh script by running the commands below. The first command invokes the script. Note that you must specify the name of the secret! In this example, the secret's name is smdemo . The subsequent commands select the database, display the table names in the database, query the rows in the table, and exit MySQL. ./mysql.newway.sh smdemo use smdemo; show tables; select * from bookinfo; quit; You can see an example of the output below.
